## 📂 Dataset

- The project uses publicly available movie datasets (e.g., IMDB, TMDB, or custom datasets). Ensure that the dataset is cleaned and preprocessed before analysis.

---

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Prerequisites
- Install Python 3.x.
- Install the required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

### 2. How to Run
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/top-movie-streaming.git
cd top-movie-streaming
```
Load your movie dataset into the root.

Run the main Jupyter notebook:

```bash
python top_movie_streaming.ipynb
```
View the generated visualizations and classification results in the output files.

### 🛠 Functionality
Key Steps in the Project:
Data Loading: Load the dataset using Pandas and inspect the data structure.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical data, and normalize numerical data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generate descriptive statistics and visualizations to identify trends.
Classification: Implement machine learning models (e.g., Decision Trees, SVM, or Neural Networks) to classify movies.
Visualization: Use Matplotlib or Seaborn to create plots showcasing analysis results.

### 📝 Future Enhancements
Add a recommendation system based on user preferences.
Include sentiment analysis of reviews for movies.
Integrate the project with a web-based UI (e.g., Streamlit).
